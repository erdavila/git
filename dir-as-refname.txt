Tests:
	Having a reference named FOO, create a reference named FOO/BAR.
	Having a reference named FOO/BAR, create a reference named FOO.
	References must be sorted:
		refs/DIR         # ~0
		refs/DIR/FILE
	Creating a reference named ~0 (or refs/FOO/~0) is still forbidden.

Review:
	struct ref_entry comments in refs.c
	Remove is_refname_available() if not used anymore

Should allow?
	refs/~0
	refs/heads/~0
	refs/remotes/~0
	refs/tags/~0
